<br>I am a rising junior at Haverford College  studying Computer Science and Mathematics<a href="https://www.haverford.edu/Haverford">  College</a>,
where I am part of the Robotics Lab Group at Haverford College, pursuing research in robotics task planning and uncertainty quantification advised by <a href="https://thao-nguyen-ai.github.io/"> Professor Nguyen Thao</a>. My research interests lie in robotics and machine learning systems.<br><br>

Previously, I worked at The North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves <a href="https://nanograv.org/">
	(NANOGrav)</a>, working on the <a
	href="https://nanograv.org/news/nsf-funds-nanograv-physics-frontiers-center">NANOGrav Physics Frontiers Center</a>, advised by <a
	href="https://www.haverford.edu/users/alommen">Professor Andrea Lommen.</a>

<!-- I have interned in the speech groups at Microsoft (in 2021) and Meta (in 2022). <br><br> -->

<!--  My bachelor thesis was on deep learning methods
for relation extraction in clinical text, supervised by <a href="http://www.iitg.ac.in/anand.ashish/index.html">Ashish
	Anand</a>.<br><br> -->

I am also member of my school <a
